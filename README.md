## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) - JavaScript runtime
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) - Package managers for Node.js
- [Sanity CLI](https://www.sanity.io/docs/getting-started-with-sanity-cli) - Command-line interface for Sanity.io

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-portfolio.git
   cd your-portfolio
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   ```

## Project Structure

The project has the following structure:

```
portfolio/
|-- public/
|-- src/
|   |-- components/
|   |-- pages/
|   |-- styles/
|   |-- App.js
|   |-- index.js
|-- sanity/
|   |-- schemas/
|   |-- sanity.json
|   |-- schema.js
|-- .gitignore
|-- package.json
|-- README.md
|-- ...
```

- `public/`: Contains static assets and the HTML template.
- `src/`: Holds the React.js source code.
- `components/`: React components used throughout the application.
- `pages/`: React components representing different pages of the portfolio.
- `styles/`: CSS or styling files.
- `App.js`: Main React component.
- `index.js`: Entry point for the React application.
- `sanity/`: Sanity.io configuration and schema files.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by version control.
- `package.json`: NPM package configuration file.
- `README.md`: Documentation file (you're reading it).

## Configuration

### Sanity.io Configuration

1. Create a new project on [Sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/).
2. Replace the contents of `sanity/sanity.json` with your project's configuration.
3. Define your content schema in `sanity/schema.js`.

### React Configuration

Modify the necessary configurations in the React application:

- Update the content fetching logic in `src/App.js` to match your Sanity.io schema.
- Customize the components and styles in `src/` to fit your design preferences.

## Development

To start the development server, run:

```bash
npm start
# or
yarn start
```

This will launch the application in development mode, and you can view it at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

## Deployment
